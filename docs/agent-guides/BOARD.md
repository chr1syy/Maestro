# Board & Agent Profiles

Guide for the Board (a persistent task DAG) and Agent Profiles (assignee override bundles). Read this before editing `src/main/board/`, `src/shared/board/`, `src/main/profiles/`, `src/shared/profiles/`, or the `board:*` / `profiles:*` IPC and CLI surfaces.

The Board is an Encore Feature that **depends on Maestro Cue** (it rides Cue's engine tick, no second timer). It was built in two passes:

- **Original build:** Profiles, data model + YAML storage, the dispatcher on the Cue tick, the kanban UI, CLI + optional auto-decompose + docs, and the opt-in **worker pool**.
- **The 10x pass** (this branch): storage hardening (1), cancellation + push events + toasts + priority (2), full CLI lifecycle parity (3), per-card worktree isolation (4), plugin-bus board events (5), a11y + multi-board UI (6).
- **Human-and-PR pass** (this branch): the `review` card status with its own marker and column (F2), and per-card PR-on-done for worktree cards (F3).

**Purity boundary:** everything under `src/shared/**` is framework-free (no Electron, no fs) so it runs in main, renderer, and CLI alike. `board-spawn.ts` is main-only (it imports the Cue executor). `board-storage.ts` / `profile-storage.ts` only touch `fs` + `js-yaml` + the shared validators, so the CLI imports them directly - there is **one** storage implementation, shared by IPC and CLI (no drift).

---

## Data model (`.maestro/board.yaml`)

A single top-level `boards:` list; each board owns its `cards:`. See [board.md](../board.md) for the YAML shape and the card-status table. Key invariants enforced in `board-storage.ts`:

- **Load fails closed.** Three distinct outcomes, and the distinction is the whole point: a **missing** file returns `[]` (the normal "no board yet" case, plus an empty file or an absent `boards:` key); a file that exists but cannot be read or parsed throws `BoardStorageError`; a valid file returns its boards. The old behavior returned `[]` on a read failure, and the next `saveBoards` then wrote that empty list over the top and destroyed every board the user had. Failing closed keeps the damaged file on disk where a human can fix it. Individual malformed cards are still skipped with a logged warning (via `validateBoard` / `validateBoardCard`) so one bad entry never blocks the rest, and duplicate board ids keep the first occurrence.
- **Writes are atomic.** `saveBoards` serializes to YAML and hands it to `atomicWriteFileSync` (`src/main/utils/atomic-json-store.ts`): write `board.yaml.tmp`, then `renameSync` over `board.yaml`. A crash or a concurrent reader sees the whole old file or the whole new file, never a truncated one. `profile-storage.ts` and `cue-yaml-write.ts` use the same helper - do not hand-roll a `writeFileSync` for any `.maestro/*.yaml`.
- **Async read-modify-write callers serialize through the shared write chain.** `enqueueBoardWrite(projectRoot, work)` runs `work` on a per-file promise chain built from `createKeyedWriteQueue()` (same module), keyed by the absolute board.yaml path so two projects never block each other. The storage mutations themselves are synchronous and cannot interleave inside one tick, but anything that reads, `await`s, then writes (the dispatcher's spawn cycle, IPC handlers) MUST go through the queue or it will clobber a concurrent mutation.
- **The write chain is process-local; cross-process writers race.** The queue and the reload-before-save discipline serialize writers inside ONE process. Atomic rename means a concurrent reader never sees a torn file, but two processes ticking the same board (the desktop app plus a `maestro-cli board tick`/`watch`, or two CLI ticks) can interleave read-modify-write and one can overwrite the other's just-persisted transition. There is deliberately no cross-process file lock yet; run one dispatcher per board at a time (the CLI tick is meant for headless/CI projects the desktop app is not also dispatching).
- **Save rejects cycles.** `saveBoards` runs `hasCycle` and throws before writing, so the DAG invariant the dispatcher relies on can never be persisted.
- **`autoDecompose?: boolean`** is off by default and only serialized when `true`.
- **Deletes keep the DAG referentially intact.** `deleteCard` splices the dead id out of every other card's `parents` AND reattaches the deleted card's own parents to its children (grandparent adoption), so deleting a middle card neither wedges its children forever nor lets them jump ahead of work they depended on. `deleteBoard` refuses a board with any non-`done` card unless `{ force: true }`.

`CardRun` records one dispatch attempt: attempt number, timestamps, `outcome`, an optional `summary` captured from the completion marker, the `workerAgentId` that ran it (pool), `worktreePath` / `worktreeBranch` when the attempt was isolated, and `prUrl` once a PR was opened for it. Cards accumulate one run per attempt so retries are auditable. `CardRunOutcome` is `done | review | blocked | error | reclaimed | canceled` (`CARD_RUN_OUTCOMES` is the runtime mirror used by the validator).

`priority?: CardPriority` (`high | normal | low`) is never serialized when `normal`: an absent priority and an explicit `normal` mean the same thing, and `cardPriorityRank` defaults it.

`prOnDone?: CardPrOnDone` (`{ targetBranch?: string }`) is the per-card PR opt-in. Absent = off, and it is never written for a card that did not ask for it, so pre-feature `board.yaml` files round-trip byte-identical. `validateCardPrOnDone` drops anything that is not a plain object (`true`, a string, an array, YAML null), which DISARMS the opt-in rather than arming a PR from a malformed file. An empty object is deliberately valid and means "resolve the repo default branch at PR time". There is no per-board default; that was scoped out.

### Card status

`CardStatus` is `triage | todo | ready | running | review | blocked | done` (`CARD_STATUSES` is the runtime mirror, and **BoardModal's column order follows that array**, so the slot is load-bearing: `review` sits between `running` and `blocked`).

`review` means "finished, but a human must approve it", split out of `blocked` so a deliberate hand-off stops looking like a failure. It is set by the dispatcher from a `card-review` marker or manually by the user. It is NOT terminal-successful: `graph.ts` requires parents strictly `'done'`, so a `review` card does not unblock its children, and `countActiveCards` ignores it so it holds no WIP slot. `review -> done` (drag, or the "Move to" picker) is the ONLY approval path.

`heldByUser?: boolean` is a **separate axis from the status**, not a seventh `CardStatus` (a new status would touch the DAG rules, the six BoardModal columns, the CLI `set-status` validation, and every `Record<CardStatus, ...>` in the tree; parking cancelled cards in `triage` was rejected because `board-decompose.ts` eats `triage` cards on boards with `autoDecompose: true`). A held card keeps whatever status it has, is never auto-promoted, and still blocks its children through the ordinary `getBlockers` rule.

---

## Profiles (`.maestro/profiles.yaml`)

An `AgentProfile` is a named override bundle (a _role_: model / effort / role-prompt / args). `resolveProfileSpawnOverrides(profile, baseValues)` merges each field as **profile -> running agent -> undefined** and returns `{ customModel, customEffort, appendSystemPrompt, customArgs }` - which map 1:1 onto the existing `SpawnAgentOptions` / `process:spawn` fields. Profiles invent **no** new spawn parameters.

`baseAgentId` is **optional** (Phase 6):

- **Set** -> the profile pins its overrides to that specific agent (the classic "layer on a base agent"). The Board dispatches such a card to exactly that agent.
- **Absent** -> a pure _pool role_ the Board floats to any FREE opt-in worker in the project, layering the role's overrides on whichever agent picks it up.

Create a pool role from the CLI with `profile create --base <agent> --pool` (`--base` only locates the project), or in the Profiles UI by choosing base agent "None (pool role)".

---

## Dispatcher lifecycle

`BoardDispatcher` (in `board-dispatcher.ts`) is deliberately pure-ish: `loadBoard`, `saveBoard`, `resolveOverrides`, and `spawn` are all injected, so the promotion / WIP / completion logic is unit-tested with fakes (no Electron, no fs, no real process). One dispatcher instance owns one board.

Per `tick()`:

1. `reclaimStaleRunning` - a `running` card with no in-flight spawn whose run started > `DEFAULT_STALE_RUNNING_MS` ago is returned to `ready` (engine-restarted-mid-run recovery). Its open run closes with the `reclaimed` outcome, NOT `error`: the host abandoned the attempt, the card did nothing wrong, and the breaker must not count it.
2. `promoteEligibleCards` - `todo` cards with all parents `done` -> `ready` (uses `getEligibleCards`, the single eligibility rule, which also skips any card carrying `heldByUser`).
3. `claimReadyCards` - claim the oldest `ready` cards up to `maxInProgress` (default `DEFAULT_MAX_IN_PROGRESS = 2`), mark `running`, open a run. **The board is persisted here, before any spawn resolves,** so re-entrant ticks see `running` and don't double-dispatch.
4. For each claim, `resolveOverrides` then `spawn`; on completion, `applyCardResult` sets the terminal status.

**Cancel.** `cancelCard(cardId)` kills a `running` card's process through the injected `cancelSpawn` dep (`cancelBoardCardRun` in `board-spawn.ts`, which remembers the Cue `runId` per card and calls `stopCueRun`) and finalizes the card back to `todo` with a `canceled` run **plus `heldByUser: true`** (AB1): the status alone would be re-promoted on the very next tick, so the hold is a separate axis that `getEligibleCards` checks before anything else. It is cleared by the Resume button in `BoardModal` (an `updateCard` writing `heldByUser: false`) and by any manual move through `updateCardStatus` in `board-storage.ts`. `validateBoardCard` only serializes the flag when it is `true`, following the `priority` precedent, so pre-feature `board.yaml` files round-trip byte-identical. The card id is tombstoned BEFORE the kill so the spawn promise resolving moments later (with a `null` exit) is discarded instead of re-finalizing the card as a failure. `canceled` and `reclaimed` runs are both skipped by the breaker's `trailingFailureCount`. IPC entry point is `board:cancelCard` -> `CueEngine.cancelBoardCard`, with a storage-only finalize fallback when no dispatcher owns the board (app restarted mid-run).

**Notify.** The optional `notify` dep announces terminal transitions (`done` / `review` / `blocked`, including force-blocks). `index.ts` maps it onto the existing `remote:notifyToast` relay via `board-toast.ts` (green auto-dismiss / yellow sticky / red sticky, `sourceAgent: 'Board'`). The payload is presentation-free; the dispatcher never picks colors. Note that `notifyCard` in `index.ts` emits `board.cardCompleted` on the `done` kind ONLY - a `review` notification is toast-only, because there is no `board.cardNeedsReview` topic yet (adding one means a host-API bump plus the vendored SDK mirror).

**Dispatch order.** `readyCardsInDispatchOrder` is the single ordering rule for both claim paths: `priority` descending (`high` > `normal` > `low`, absent = `normal`), then `createdAt` ascending, then board order.

`applyCardResult` precedence: **block marker -> `blocked` (outcome `blocked`); review marker -> `review` (outcome `review`, reason as the summary); complete marker or clean exit -> `done` (outcome `done`); otherwise a failed run** (outcome `error` when the spawn errored or the exit code is `null`, else `blocked`) that retries (`ready`) until the circuit breaker (`DEFAULT_MAX_FAILURES = 2` consecutive non-completing runs) forces `blocked`. Block and review markers are both authoritative - they win over a non-zero exit and are never retried - and `trailingFailureCount` RESETS on a `review` outcome the way it does on `done` (a review reached a deliberate conclusion, so it is not evidence the card cannot succeed; `reclaimed` / `canceled` are skipped rather than resetting). A card whose profile can't be resolved is force-blocked immediately (bypassing the breaker - retrying a missing profile is pointless). The worktree path/branch is stamped on the run for EVERY outcome, failures included: the branch still exists and is worth inspecting.

**Status-change hook.** `snapshotCardStatuses` before a mutation and `diffCardStatuses` after it produce the transitions that were actually persisted, which is what the injected `onStatusChanged` dep (and, through it, the plugin bus) reports. A promote and a claim landing in the same save collapse into one `todo -> running` change - that is deliberate: it matches what an observer reading `board.yaml` would see. Cards that appeared mid-tick (auto-decompose children) are skipped, since they never transitioned.

**Engine wiring:** `cue-engine.ts` `boardDispatchTick()` runs on the shared heartbeat, dual-gated on `maestroCue && board` (read fresh each tick). It keeps one `BoardDispatcher` per `${projectRoot}::${boardId}`, created lazily and dropped when the board vanishes. The host side effects are injected from `src/main/index.ts` via `board-spawn.ts` (`resolveCardOverrides`, `resolveCardAssignment`, `spawnBoardCard`), which run the card through the SAME `executeCuePrompt` path Cue uses - so SSH config, custom env/path, and token-source selection are honored (never bypass the SSH path).

---

## Worker pool (Phase 6)

By default (no `assign` dep) the dispatcher runs the **legacy path**: one card resolves to one pinned agent via `resolveOverrides`. When the injected `assign` dep is present (it is, in both `index.ts` and the CLI), the dispatcher runs the **pooled path** (`tickPooled` -> `claimReadyCardsPooled`):

- **Pool = opt-in + in-directory.** An agent is an eligible worker only when its session has `boardWorker: true` **and** its working dir is inside the board's project dir (or a sub-folder). `selectPoolAgentIds` (in `pool.ts`) is the single definition, shared by `index.ts` and the CLI. The `boardWorker` toggle lives on `EditAgentModal` (default OFF - an interactive agent is never hijacked).
- **Assignee resolution** (`resolveCardAssignment` in `board-spawn.ts`, mirrored by `resolveCliAssignment`): a named-but-missing profile -> `unresolvable` (block); a pinned agent (`card.assigneeAgentId`, or a legacy profile's `baseAgentId`) -> a single candidate; a role-only card -> the free project pool. The first candidate **not** already running a board card wins (`computeBusyAgentIds` recomputes the busy set from the persisted board each tick, so "one card per worker" survives restarts - the worker id is stamped on `CardRun.workerAgentId`).
- **All busy -> wait, don't block.** When every candidate is busy (or the pool is empty), `assign` returns `no-free-worker`; the card stays `ready` and retries on a later tick. Concurrency is bounded by free-worker count **and** the WIP cap (whichever is lower).
- **Card assignee** (`BoardCard`): `assigneeProfileId` (role) and/or `assigneeAgentId` (pin); at least one is required (`validateBoardCard`). Set from `BoardModal` (Role + "Pin to agent" selects) or the CLI (`board add-card --assignee <profileId> --assignee-agent <agentId>`).
- **The busy set is per board, not per project.** `computeBusyAgentIds(board)` reads only the board being ticked, and each board gets its own `BoardDispatcher`, so "one card per worker" is a per-board guarantee: two boards in the same project can assign the same agent concurrently. Fixing it means a project-wide busy set computed across every board before any of them claim - a deliberate non-goal so far, not an oversight.

---

## Worktree isolation (per card)

A card carrying a `WorktreeRef` runs in its own checkout instead of the shared project root, so cards dispatched in the same tick cannot collide.

- **One provisioning implementation.** `setupWorktreeLocal` in `src/main/utils/git-worktree.ts` is the only local `git worktree add` in the app: the `git:worktreeSetup` IPC handler (Auto Run) and `ensureCardWorktree` in `board-worktree.ts` (Board) both call it. Do NOT hand-roll git worktree shell calls.
- **Naming** comes from `src/shared/board/worktree.ts` (pure, so the renderer editor, the CLI `--worktree` flag, and the dispatcher agree): branch `board/<boardId-8>/<cardId-8>`, checked out at `<sibling-of-projectRoot>/worktrees/<branch>`. The sibling layout is mandatory - `setupWorktreeLocal` refuses a worktree nested inside the main repo.
- **Lifecycle:** created lazily on the first claim that spawns the card, reused by every retry, never auto-deleted and never auto-merged. The branch is surfaced in the completion toast, on the card tile, and in the "Last run summary"; merging is the user's job (see [board.md](../board.md)).
- **The cwd switch happens in the spawner, not the dispatcher.** `board-spawn.ts` passes the checkout as `CueExecutionConfig.projectRoot` (which IS the spawn cwd); the CLI passes it as `spawnAgent`'s cwd. The resolved path/branch come back on `CardSpawnResult` and `applyCardResult` stamps them onto the `CardRun`.
- **SSH is refused, not silently downgraded.** An agent with `sshRemoteConfig.enabled` executes on the remote host where a locally created worktree does not exist, so an isolated card on such an agent is blocked with a reason.

---

## PR on done (per card)

A card carrying `prOnDone` opens a pull request for its worktree branch when it lands in `done`. Nothing is merged; the branch is just put in front of a reviewer.

- **One gh-CLI implementation.** `createPullRequest` in `src/main/utils/pr-creator.ts` is it: shell-PATH build, `git push -u origin HEAD` from the worktree, `gh pr create`, and the "gh not installed" error mapping. It was LIFTED out of the `git:createPR` IPC handler, which now calls it (unchanged IPC signature, `baseBranch` still required and passed through as an explicit target). `resolveDefaultBranch` in the same module backs `git:getDefaultBranch`. Do NOT add a second `gh pr create` call site, and do NOT reach for the renderer's `useWorktreeManager.createPR` from main.
- **Target resolution lives in the helper:** explicit `targetBranch` -> `resolveDefaultBranch(mainRepoCwd)` (remote HEAD, then local `main`, then `master`) -> the literal `'main'`. The probe runs in the MAIN repo, not the worktree. The renderer used to own this three-step order; it is now duplicated nowhere.
- **The gate is pure and testable.** `resolveCardPrRequest(board, cardId)` in `board-pr.ts` returns a request only when the card exists, is `done`, has `prOnDone`, its LATEST run has a `worktreeBranch` and no `prUrl` yet, and a checkout path is known (`run.worktreePath`, falling back to `card.worktree.path`). `run.prUrl` is what makes a re-fire, or a `done -> todo -> done` round trip, idempotent.
- **Two call sites, one helper.** `finalize` in the dispatcher fires the injected `createCardPr?: (cardId) => void` dep AFTER `saveAndAnnounce`, never awaited (gh takes seconds and must not block the tick); the `board:setCardStatus` handler fires `startCardPr` after its write when the new status is `done`, which is the manual `review -> done` approval path. Both land in `maybeCreateCardPr`.
- **The stamp is ONE closure, not a load/save pair.** Deps expose `stampPrUrl(cardId, prUrl)`, and `startCardPr` implements it as a re-read plus write inside `enqueueBoardWrite`. Handing the flow a `saveBoard` it could call at an arbitrary later moment would let a seconds-old snapshot clobber a tick's write.
- **A module-level in-flight set** in `startCardPr`, keyed `projectRoot::boardId::cardId`, is what stops a dispatcher finalize overlapping a human drag from opening two PRs. `run.prUrl` only makes a SEQUENCE of attempts idempotent - it is not written until gh answers. The slot is released on failure so a retry is possible.
- **Failures never touch card status.** A gh/push failure warn-logs and red-toasts (`buildCardPrToastPayload` in `board-toast.ts`); the card stays `done`. Success toasts green with an `open-url` clickAction to the PR.
- **The CLI wires nothing.** Headless `board tick` calls `applyCardResult` directly, so CLI-driven cards never open PRs - consistent with how it treats `notify` / `cancelSpawn`.
- **Inherits the local-only constraint.** Worktree cards refuse SSH, so the PR path never has to think about remotes.

## Plugin-bus board events

The Board publishes four read-only topics on the plugin event bus so other plugins can build on it. All four are declared in `src/shared/plugins/events.ts` (`PLUGIN_EVENT_TOPICS` + `PluginEventPayloads`) and emitted from `src/main/index.ts` through the board deps the Cue engine calls.

| Topic                     | Fired from                           | Payload                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `board.cardStatusChanged` | `onCardStatusChanged` dep            | `boardId`, `cardId`, `cardTitle`, `fromStatus`, `toStatus`, `attempt?`, `workerAgentId?`, `projectPath?` |
| `board.cardCompleted`     | `notifyCard` dep (`kind: 'done'`)    | ids + `attempt?`, `workerAgentId?`, `worktreeBranch?`, `projectPath?`                                    |
| `board.cardBlocked`       | `notifyCard` dep (`kind: 'blocked'`) | ids + `attempt?`, `workerAgentId?`, `outcome?` (the enum, never the reason text)                         |
| `board.decomposed`        | `onBoardDecomposed` dep              | `boardId`, `triageCardCount`, `projectPath?`                                                             |

- **Metadata only, and that is a rule, not a default.** No prompt body, run output, run summary, or block reason ever rides these topics. `cardTitle` is the single human-authored string, shipped because it is the card's identity in the UI (note that auto-decomposed titles originate from a model). `board.cardBlocked` carries the `outcome` CLASSIFICATION precisely so a subscriber never needs the free-form reason. Keep any new field on this side of that line.
- **The same call site does both jobs.** `notifyCard` in `index.ts` emits the plugin event AND fires the `remote:notifyToast` relay; the toast carries the summary, the event does not.
- **Null-safe throughout.** Every emit goes through `pluginEventBus?.emit(...)`, and the deps themselves are optional on `CueEngineDeps`, so the dispatcher runs unchanged when plugins are off or when the CLI owns the tick (the CLI wires no bus).
- **Host-API version.** These topics shipped in `HOST_API_VERSION = '1.15.0'` (`src/shared/plugins/host-api.ts`), on top of `rc`'s 1.14.0 (`tool.executed` + `ui.panelPost`).
- **First-party manifest.** `BOARD_FIRST_PARTY_PLUGIN` in `src/shared/plugins/first-party.ts` declares the Board's broker capabilities (`settings:read`, `sessions:read`, `notifications:toast`, scoped `fs:read` / `fs:write` on `.maestro/`). `agents:dispatch` and `process:spawn` are deliberately ABSENT: the Board dispatches to a dynamically-resolved target that a static manifest scope cannot name, so that authority stays host-owned until the runtime grant seam in [rfc-runtime-dispatch-grants.md](../../Plans/rfc-runtime-dispatch-grants.md) exists. Per-card worktree provisioning is host-owned for the same reason.

---

## Completion markers & handoff

`parseCardMarkers` (in `cardMarkers.ts`, mirrors `goalMarkers.ts`) scans a run's output for `<!-- maestro:card-complete [| summary] -->`, `<!-- maestro:card-review[: reason] -->`, and `<!-- maestro:card-block[: reason] -->`, last-match-wins per type. The parser reports all three flags faithfully and decides nothing: **precedence is the dispatcher's job** (block > review > complete), so do not fold it into the parser. `CARD_HANDOFF_REMINDER` (also in `cardMarkers.ts`, so CLI and desktop share one copy) is prepended to every card prompt to encourage the four-question handoff in the summary and to teach all three markers: fix what you can safely fix and card-complete, card-review when the work needs human judgment or verification, card-block only when genuinely stuck. The captured summary lands on `CardRun.summary` and is surfaced in `BoardModal` as an expandable "Last run summary". It is optional metadata - the run completes without it (falling back to the exit status).

---

## Auto-decompose (optional, off by default)

`board-decompose.ts` is framework-free and strictly gated: `autoDecomposeBoard` returns `0` immediately unless `board.autoDecompose === true`. When on, it takes up to `DEFAULT_AUTO_DECOMPOSE_PER_TICK` (3) `triage` cards, runs one LLM pass each (the injected `spawn` + the editable `board-decompose` prompt), parses the fenced-JSON child list with `parseDecomposition` (which clamps `dependsOn` to earlier, in-range, non-self indices so the produced sub-graph is always acyclic), appends the children as `todo` cards wired to the triage umbrella + siblings, and retires the triage card to `done` so it is never re-expanded.

- **CLI:** `board tick` calls `autoDecomposeBoard` inside `tickBoard`, loading the template via `getCliPrompt`.
- **Desktop:** `cue-engine.ts` `maybeAutoDecompose` fires the optional `decompose` dep (wired in `index.ts` with `getPrompt` + `decomposeBoardCard`) as a guarded, fire-and-forget step; the `boardDecomposeInFlight` set prevents a slow pass from being relaunched and a triage card double-expanded. Children are dispatched on a subsequent tick.

The prompt is registered in `src/shared/promptDefinitions.ts` (`PROMPT_IDS.BOARD_DECOMPOSE`, file `src/prompts/board-decompose.md`) so it is editable in Settings -> Maestro Prompts.

---

## CLI

`src/cli/commands/board.ts` and `profile.ts` mirror the IPC surface via the same storage modules. Every command resolves the project root from `--agent` (id or name). `board tick` reuses the pure dispatcher helpers (`promoteEligibleCards` / `claimReadyCards` / `applyCardResult` / `reclaimStaleRunning`) and the existing CLI `spawnAgent` path - it does **not** fork a second spawn implementation. Commands follow the repo's try/catch-at-boundary convention (throw internally, print + `process.exit(1)` once in the catch). See [cli-reference](../cli-reference.md) for the flag matrix; user-facing overview in [board.md](../board.md).

Full lifecycle parity (Phase 3 of the 10x pass), so a CI box never needs the desktop app:

| Board                                                     | Profile                                          |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `create` / `rename` / `delete` / `list` / `show`          | `create` / `update` / `show` / `list` / `delete` |
| `add-card` / `update-card` / `remove-card` / `set-status` |                                                  |

Rules worth knowing before you extend this surface:

- **Storage owns the guard rails, not the CLI.** `deleteBoard` refuses a board with any non-`done` card unless `{ force: true }`, so the desktop path inherits the same rule (`board:delete` IPC forwards the flag). Do not re-implement a check like this in a command.
- **Editing is id-preserving.** `profile update` upserts with the EXISTING id. `profile create` mints a new UUID, which orphans every card whose `assigneeProfileId` points at the old one - that was the entire bug this command fixes.
- **Only the flags you pass are touched.** `board update-card` and `profile update` diff against the stored record; an explicit empty string (`--assignee ''`, `--model ''`) is the clear operation, and a call with no flags is refused rather than silently rewriting the file.
- **The CLI cannot cancel a run.** A `running` card's process belongs to whichever dispatcher claimed it, in another process. `board update-card` refuses a `running` card outright; `board remove-card --force` deletes it but says plainly that the run was not canceled. Do not add a command that claims to stop an agent it has no handle on.
- **`board watch` is deliberately dumb.** One shared `tickBoardsOnce` pass on a timer (`--interval`, default 30s, floor 5s), stopped by SIGINT, which also wakes the sleep so Ctrl-C is instant. No daemon, no lock file, no PID file. Do NOT overlap it with the desktop Cue engine tick (or a second `watch`) on the same boards: atomic writes prevent torn files, but the write chain is process-local, so two dispatchers' read-modify-write cycles can interleave and one can overwrite the other's just-persisted card transition (see the storage section above). A storage failure exits non-zero instead of spinning on a damaged file.

## Gotchas

- **Board requires Cue.** The dual gate is read fresh each tick; the Extensions pane also disables the Board toggle while Cue is off (`BUILTIN_DEPENDENCIES` in `extensionModel.ts`).
- **The pool never hijacks an interactive agent.** Only agents with `boardWorker: true` are auto-assigned role-only cards; the flag defaults OFF. A card can still _pin_ any in-project agent by name regardless of the flag (explicit intent). Board card spawns are independent headless `executeCuePrompt` runs - they do **not** attach to the agent's live AI tab.
- **Persist before spawn.** Never reorder `claimReadyCards` after the spawn - the pre-spawn save is what prevents double-dispatch.
- **`ready` is derived.** Authors write `todo`; the dispatcher computes `ready`. Do not hand-persist `ready` cards expecting them to stay put.
- **The kanban does not poll.** `saveBoards` fires the `setBoardSavedListener` hook, the host (`src/main/index.ts`, next to the other startup wiring) broadcasts `board:changed { projectRoot }` to every window via `safeSend`, and both `BoardModal` (through `window.maestro.board.onBoardChanged`) and the header's `BoardStatusIndicator` refetch on it. `saveProfiles` mirrors it exactly: `setProfilesSavedListener` -> `profiles:changed` -> `window.maestro.profiles.onProfilesChanged` -> `ProfilesModal`. Both hooks live in the host, not in storage, because the CLI imports the same storage modules and has no `webContents`; both are advisory (a listener that throws is logged and never fails the write that already landed). There is exactly one listener per store, set once at startup, last-write-wins - do not add a second broadcast site.
- **Worktree isolation refuses SSH, it does not downgrade.** `board-spawn.ts` blocks an isolated card whose base agent has `sshRemoteConfig.enabled` with `WORKTREE_SSH_UNSUPPORTED` (from `board-worktree.ts`) instead of provisioning locally. A local checkout is invisible to an agent executing on a remote host, so "isolate it anyway" would silently run the card in the wrong tree. The remote variant (`worktreeSetupRemote` in `utils/remote-git.ts`) is deliberately NOT wired in - do not reach for it without designing remote cleanup first.
- **Keyboard parity is a "Move to" picker, not ARIA drag-and-drop.** Tiles are `role="button" tabIndex={0}`; arrows walk the grid, Enter opens the card, `m` opens its editor focused on the "Move to" select (which persists through `setCardStatus` immediately, with the same running/derived-status guards as a drop), and Delete twice removes it. Native HTML5 DnD stays for pointer users only - do not reimplement it as a custom ARIA drag surface.
- **`review` is not a success terminal.** It looks terminal in the UI, but `graph.ts` gates children on strictly `'done'`, so anything keying off "the card finished" must decide explicitly whether `review` counts. It currently does not: no child promotion, no `board.cardCompleted` event, no PR.
- **The Review column shares Running's yellow.** `ThemeColors` has exactly `success` / `warning` / `error`, so `warning` is the only warning-family key and `STATUS_META.review` uses it. That is a palette limitation, not a decision - do not "fix" it by inventing a sixth semantic color, and do not write tests asserting the column's color.
- **Multi-board selection is a UI preference, not a setting.** The last board opened per project lives in `localStorage` under `maestro.board.lastBoardId:<projectRoot>`, next to the other view-state keys. It is deliberately not in the settings store: nothing outside the modal reads it.
- **Cross-platform paths.** All board/profile file paths go through `path.join` on `BOARD_CONFIG_PATH` / `PROFILES_CONFIG_PATH` (`src/shared/maestro-paths.ts`), and project roots come from stored sessions - no separator or home-dir assumptions, so the Windows CI leg stays green.
