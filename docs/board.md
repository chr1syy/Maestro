description: A persistent board (a DAG of cards) that dispatches work to Agent Profiles automatically, gated on dependencies and a work-in-progress cap.

The **Board** turns a project into a persistent, git-trackable graph of cards. Each **card** is a unit of work assigned to an **Agent Profile**, and a card only becomes eligible to run once every card it depends on is `done`. On the Maestro Cue heartbeat, a dispatcher drains the graph: it promotes eligible cards, spawns their assignees, and moves them to `done`, `review`, or `blocked` based on how the run ended.

The Board is an Encore Feature and depends on **Maestro Cue** (the Board rides Cue's engine tick, so Cue must be enabled too). The manual Board is fully useful on its own; auto-decompose is a separate, off-by-default layer.

## Data model

The board lives in `.maestro/board.yaml` at the project root, alongside `.maestro/cue.yaml`. It is human-diffable and meant to be committed. A board holds an ordered list of cards:

```yaml
boards:
  - id: 8f3c1d2e
    name: Backend rework
    maxInProgress: 2 # optional work-in-progress cap
    autoDecompose: false # optional, off by default
    cards:
      - id: a
        title: Design the schema
        body: Lay out the tables and relationships.
        assigneeProfileId: architect
        parents: []
        status: todo
        priority: high # optional: high | normal | low (normal is the default and is not written)
        createdAt: 2026-07-10T00:00:00.000Z
        updatedAt: 2026-07-10T00:00:00.000Z
      - id: b
        title: Add the migration
        body: Implement the migration from the design.
        assigneeProfileId: builder
        assigneeAgentId: agent-2 # optional: pin this card to one agent
        parents: [a] # waits until card "a" is done
        status: done
        worktree: # optional: run this card in its own checkout
          branch: board/8f3c1d2e/b
          path: /home/you/worktrees/board/8f3c1d2e/b
        prOnDone: # optional: open a pull request when this card finishes
          targetBranch: develop # optional; omit for the repo's default branch
        runs: # one entry per dispatch attempt, appended by the dispatcher
          - attempt: 1
            startedAt: 2026-07-10T00:05:00.000Z
            endedAt: 2026-07-10T00:19:00.000Z
            outcome: done
            summary: Added the migration and a round-trip test.
            workerAgentId: agent-2
            worktreeBranch: board/8f3c1d2e/b
            prUrl: https://github.com/you/repo/pull/42
```

Cards are written by hand or by the app; the `runs` list, the derived statuses, and the timestamps are the dispatcher's bookkeeping. Each run records one attempt and never disappears, so a card that took three tries keeps all three.

### Run outcomes

| Outcome     | Meaning                                                                                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `done`      | The run completed (complete marker, or a clean exit with no marker).                          |
| `review`    | The run finished its work but asked a human to approve it (review marker).                    |
| `blocked`   | The run asked for a human (block marker) or exited non-zero with no completion signal.        |
| `error`     | The run could not be carried out (spawn failure, killed process).                             |
| `reclaimed` | The app was restarted mid-run, so the attempt was abandoned and the card returned to `ready`. |
| `canceled`  | You pressed stop on the card, which also holds it (see below).                                |

`reclaimed` and `canceled` runs do not count toward the circuit breaker: neither one says anything about whether the work is doable. A `review` run resets the breaker the way `done` does, because it reached a deliberate conclusion rather than failing.

### Card status

| Status    | Meaning                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `triage`  | Captured but not groomed. Never auto-run; waits for a human (or auto-decompose).                                   |
| `todo`    | Accepted work, waiting on its parents. Also where a card you stopped waits, held until you resume it.              |
| `ready`   | Derived: a `todo` card whose parents are all `done`. The dispatcher promotes these; you do not hand-write `ready`. |
| `running` | A dispatcher has spawned an agent for this card and it is in flight.                                               |
| `review`  | The work is finished but a human must approve it before it counts. Not a failure, and never auto-retried.          |
| `blocked` | A run finished without completing, or a parent regressed. Needs attention.                                         |
| `done`    | Completed successfully. Unblocks children that depend on it.                                                       |

### Review: work that needs a human

`review` exists so that "I finished, but somebody should look at this" stops being confused with "I got stuck", which is what `blocked` means. A card lands in `review` when its agent emits the review marker (see completion markers below), or when you move it there yourself.

A card sitting in `review` is inert: nothing retries it, nothing counts it against the circuit breaker, and it holds no slot against the WIP cap. Crucially it does **not** unblock its children - a child only becomes eligible once every parent is strictly `done` - so a card parked for approval keeps the work behind it parked too.

The only way out is a human: move the card from **Review** to **Done** (drag it, or press `m` on the tile and use the "Move to" picker). That single move is the approval, and it is what releases the children. Moving it back to `todo` sends it around again instead.

## Profiles

An **Agent Profile** is the "assignee" a card points at. A profile is a named override bundle layered on an existing Left Bar agent (the "base agent"): it overrides the model, reasoning effort, role system-prompt, and optionally extra CLI args, while keeping the base agent's binary, working directory, custom env, and SSH config. Profiles live in `.maestro/profiles.yaml`:

```yaml
profiles:
  - id: architect
    name: Architect
    baseAgentId: agent-1
    model: claude-opus-4-8
    effort: high
    appendSystemPrompt: You are a careful systems designer.
```

At spawn time each field resolves as **profile value, then base agent value, then unset** - so a profile only overrides what it names.

## Dispatcher lifecycle

On each Maestro Cue engine tick, the Board dispatcher runs one pass per board (gated on both the Cue and Board Encore flags, read fresh each tick):

1. **Reclaim** stale `running` cards. A card left `running` with no live process (for example after the app restarted mid-run) is returned to `ready` and its open run is closed as `reclaimed`.
2. **Auto-decompose** (optional, see below).
3. **Promote** every `todo` card whose parents are all `done` to `ready`, skipping any card you have stopped and not yet resumed.
4. **Claim** `ready` cards up to the work-in-progress cap, mark each `running`, open a run record, and spawn its assignee. The board is persisted _before_ any spawn resolves, so a crash or the next tick sees the cards as `running` and never double-dispatches them.
5. **Apply** each finished run's outcome (see completion markers).

A card that fails repeatedly is force-blocked by a circuit breaker (two consecutive non-completing runs by default), so a broken card cannot spin forever.

### Dispatch order and priority

When more cards are `ready` than the WIP cap allows, they are claimed by **priority descending** (`high`, then `normal`, then `low`), then **oldest first** within a priority, then board order. A card with no `priority` counts as `normal`, so raising one card to `high` is enough to jump the queue without re-prioritizing everything else. Set it in the card editor or with `--priority high` on `board add-card` / `board update-card`.

## Stopping a running card

Press **Stop** on a `running` card to kill its agent process. The attempt is recorded as a `canceled` run, which does not count against the circuit breaker. A cancel is safe to press even if the run happens to finish at the same moment: the late result is discarded rather than overwriting the cancellation.

Stop is a **hold**, not a pause that expires. The card returns to **To Do** carrying an explicit user hold, and the dispatcher's promote pass skips held cards entirely, so it will not be picked up again on the next tick or any tick after it. A held tile shows a `held` badge so it is clear why it is sitting still.

You resume it yourself, either way:

- Press **Resume** on the tile (it appears in the same spot Stop occupied).
- Move the card out of To Do and back - drag it, press `m` on the tile and use the "Move to" picker, or run `maestro-cli board set-status <cardId> todo`. Any manual status move releases the hold.

A held card does **not** unblock its children, exactly like any other non-`done` card: a child only becomes eligible once every parent is strictly `done`. So stopping a card parks the work behind it too.

Cancellation itself is a desktop-app action. `maestro-cli` cannot stop an in-flight run, because the agent process belongs to whichever dispatcher started it, in another process. Releasing a hold from the CLI works fine, because that is only a board file change.

## Notifications

Terminal card transitions raise a toast:

- **Card done** - green, auto-dismissing. Names the worktree branch when the run was isolated.
- **Card needs review** - yellow and sticky, carrying the reason the agent gave. It is waiting on your approval.
- **Card blocked** - red and sticky, because it is waiting on you. Click to dismiss.

A card that opened a pull request raises one more toast: green with the PR link (click it to open the PR), or red and sticky with the `gh` error if the PR could not be created.

Both are stamped as coming from **Board**. When a card is in flight, the Main Window header also shows a small Board pill with the number of `running` and `ready` cards across the project; click it to open the Board. The pill hides itself when nothing is happening.

## Multiple boards

A project can hold as many boards as you like in the same `.maestro/board.yaml`. Use the board picker in the Board window header to switch, rename, or delete the current board, and **New board** to create one. Maestro remembers the last board you had open per project.

Every board is dispatched independently, each with its own `maxInProgress` cap and its own view of which workers are busy, so splitting work across boards raises total concurrency. Keep that in mind if you rely on the pool's one-card-per-worker rule: it holds within a board, and two boards in the same project can hand the same agent a card at the same time. Pin cards to different agents, or keep parallel work on one board, if that matters to you.

Deleting a board takes its cards and their run history with it, so a board with anything that is not `done` asks for confirmation first (`--force` from the CLI).

## Completion markers

When a card's agent finishes, it signals the outcome with an HTML-comment marker in its output. These mirror the Auto Run halt marker style:

```text
<!-- maestro:card-complete -->
<!-- maestro:card-complete | one-line summary of what changed -->
<!-- maestro:card-review: what a human needs to check -->
<!-- maestro:card-block: reason it could not finish -->
```

Precedence: a block marker wins (the card goes to `blocked`); then a review marker (the card goes to `review`); otherwise a complete marker (or a clean exit with no marker) sends the card to `done`. Both the block and the review marker are authoritative - they beat even a non-zero exit and are never retried. The reason after `card-review:` is optional and lands on the card's run as its summary, so it shows in the toast and on the tile.

Cards are told to fix whatever they can safely fix and card-complete it, to use card-review when the work is done but needs human judgment or verification, and to reserve card-block for genuinely being stuck. The optional summary after `card-complete |` is captured onto the card's latest run and surfaced in the UI as an expandable "Last run summary". Cards encourage a four-question handoff in that summary - what changed, how it was verified, what it unblocks, and any residual risk - so the next card inherits useful context. The summary is optional metadata; the run still completes without it.

## WIP limits

`maxInProgress` caps how many cards a board may have `running` at once (default 2). The cap is enforced across the whole board, so already-running cards count against it. This keeps the board from launching every ready card at once and lets you tune throughput per project.

## Auto-decompose (optional, off by default)

With `autoDecompose: true` on a board, the dispatcher may take a `triage` card and run one LLM pass to fan it into a small graph of child cards, with their dependencies wired. It is capped per tick (three triage cards by default) to prevent runaway expansion, and a decomposed triage card is retired to `done` so it is never re-expanded. When the flag is off (the default), `triage` cards simply wait for manual promotion. The decomposition prompt is the editable `board-decompose` core prompt (Settings, Maestro Prompts).

## Worktree cards

A card can run in its own git worktree instead of the shared project directory. Turn on **Run in isolated worktree** in the card editor, or pass `--worktree` to `board add-card` / `board update-card`. Parallel cards then edit different working trees, so two agents dispatched in the same tick cannot collide on each other's files or git state.

What happens:

- The checkout is created on the card's first run, on branch `board/<board-id>/<card-id>` (the full ids, sanitized for git, so two cards can never share a checkout), in a `worktrees/` folder beside your project directory. Set an explicit path or branch on the card to override either.
- Retries reuse the same worktree, so a second attempt continues the work instead of starting from a clean tree.
- When the card finishes, the branch name appears in the completion toast, as a badge on the card tile, and under the card's **Last run summary**.
- Nothing is merged or deleted for you. The branch and its checkout stay exactly where the agent left them.

Merging a finished card branch back yourself:

```bash
# From your main checkout
git merge board/8f3c1d2e/b

# Then, when you no longer need the isolated checkout
git worktree remove ../worktrees/board/8f3c1d2e/b
git branch -d board/8f3c1d2e/b
```

### Open a PR when the card is done

An isolated card can open a pull request for its branch the moment it finishes. Turn on **Open PR when done** in the card editor's worktree section (it only appears once **Run in isolated worktree** is on) and optionally name a **PR target branch**; leave that blank to target the repository's default branch, resolved when the PR is actually opened rather than baked into `board.yaml`.

What happens when such a card reaches `done`: Maestro pushes the card's branch and runs `gh pr create` against the target branch, with the card title as the PR title and the card body plus the run's handoff summary as the PR description. The resulting URL is toasted, stored on the card's run as `prUrl`, and never opened twice for the same run. Nothing is merged - the branch is still yours to merge, the PR just puts it in front of a reviewer.

This fires from both routes into `done`: a run that completed on its own, and the human approval move when a card was parked in **Review**. So the natural pairing is a card that emits `card-review`, waits for you, and opens its PR at the moment you approve it.

Requirements and edges worth knowing:

- The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`) must be installed and authenticated. A failure (no `gh`, no auth, a rejected push) raises a red sticky toast and leaves the card `done` - the PR is a side effect, never a gate on the card's status.
- The option only does anything on a card with worktree isolation on and a branch actually recorded on its last run. A card that ran in the shared project root has no branch to open a PR for and is silently skipped.
- It is a desktop-app feature. `maestro-cli board tick` applies card outcomes but does not open pull requests.
- Removing the toggle (or isolation) simply drops the field from `board.yaml`; boards written before this option existed are unaffected.

Worktree cards are local-only: an agent configured to run over an SSH remote executes on the remote host, where a worktree created on your machine does not exist. Such a card is blocked with a clear reason rather than quietly running in the shared project directory. Clear its worktree setting or move it to a local agent.

## CLI

The Board and Profiles are fully drivable headlessly with `maestro-cli`, mirroring the in-app actions. Every command resolves the project from a target agent.

```bash
# Profiles
maestro-cli profile list --agent <id-or-name>
maestro-cli profile create --base <agentId> --name Reviewer --model claude-opus-4-8 --effort high --role "Be adversarial."
maestro-cli profile show <profileId> --agent <id-or-name>
maestro-cli profile update <profileId> --agent <id-or-name> --model claude-opus-4-8 --role-prompt "Be adversarial." --args "--verbose"
maestro-cli profile delete <profileId> --agent <id-or-name>

# Boards
maestro-cli board create "Backend rework" --agent <id-or-name> --max-in-progress 2
maestro-cli board list --agent <id-or-name>
maestro-cli board show <boardId> --agent <id-or-name>
maestro-cli board rename <boardId> "New name" --agent <id-or-name>
maestro-cli board delete <boardId> --agent <id-or-name> [--force]

# Cards
maestro-cli board add-card <boardId> --agent <id-or-name> --title "Design schema" --assignee <profileId> --body "..." --parents <id1,id2> --worktree
maestro-cli board update-card <cardId> --agent <id-or-name> --title "Design the schema" --priority high
maestro-cli board remove-card <cardId> --agent <id-or-name>
maestro-cli board set-status <cardId> done --agent <id-or-name>

# Run one dispatcher pass headlessly (promote, claim, spawn, apply)
maestro-cli board tick --agent <id-or-name>

# ...or keep ticking until Ctrl-C
maestro-cli board watch --agent <id-or-name> --interval 60
```

`board tick` reuses the same promotion, WIP, and completion logic as the desktop dispatcher and the same agent spawn path as the rest of the CLI, so SSH remotes and profile model/effort/role overrides are honored exactly as they are in the app. Drive an entire board to completion by adding cards with dependencies, then running `board tick` until every card is terminal (`done`, `review`, or `blocked`) - a single pass can leave cards `running`, `ready`, or awaiting a retry, so check `board show --json` (card `status` fields) rather than stopping after a quiet tick. Add `--json` to any command for machine-readable output.

A few behaviors worth knowing:

- `board create` is the bootstrap command: a board id is all the other commands need, so you never have to open the app to start a headless workflow.
- `board delete` refuses a board that still has cards which are not `done` unless you pass `--force`. It takes the whole board, cards and run history included.
- `board update-card` and `profile update` change only the flags you actually pass. Pass an empty string (`--assignee ""`, `--model ""`) to clear a field. `profile update` keeps the profile's id, so cards assigned to that role keep working; `profile create` would mint a new id and leave them pointing at nothing.
- A `running` card cannot be edited, and removing one needs `--force`. The CLI has no handle on the in-flight agent process (it belongs to whichever dispatcher started it), so it cannot stop the run for you - use the stop button on the card in the app.
- `board set-status` takes any status, `review` included, so a headless approval is `board set-status <cardId> done`. It does not open a pull request for a card carrying `prOnDone` - that is a desktop-app step (see worktree cards above).
- `board watch` is just `board tick` on a timer (default 30 seconds, minimum 5), stopped with Ctrl-C. It does not daemonize and takes no lock. Running two dispatchers on the same board (the desktop app with Cue enabled, plus a `watch`) is unsupported: each one can overwrite the other's latest card transition, because their read-modify-write cycles are not serialized across processes (atomic writes only prevent torn files). Pick one dispatcher per board - the CLI tick is meant for headless projects the app is not also dispatching.
