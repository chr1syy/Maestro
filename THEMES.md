## Vibes

### Pedurple

Pedram's signature `#9146FF` on a neutral slate base. Purple is the accent, not the wallpaper.

### Maestro's Choice

We asked Maestro to make a theme for itself, this is what it came up with.

## Showcase Mode

Every screenshot above is shot against **curated demo data**, never a real
workspace. Showcase Mode seeds a throwaway data directory with a fictional
twelve-agent fleet and launches the dev app pointed at it, so nothing published
here carries a real project path, client name, or spend figure.

```bash
# Dracula, default window size
npm run dev:showcase

# A specific theme
npm run dev:showcase -- --theme pedurple

# Theme plus the exact window size these screenshots use
# (2304x1360 logical pixels, 4608x2720 at 2x retina)
npm run dev:showcase -- --theme catppuccin-latte --size 2304x1360
```

`--theme` takes any id from `THEMES` in `src/shared/themes.ts`. The seed data is
regenerated from `scripts/showcase/seed/data/` on every launch, so edits made
while the showcase is running are discarded the next time you start it.

### Capturing the whole set

`npm run capture:showcase` drives the running app over Chrome DevTools Protocol
and shoots every surface in the shot list, in each theme, without a human
clicking through them. See
[docs/agent-guides/SCREENSHOT-CAPTURE.md](docs/agent-guides/SCREENSHOT-CAPTURE.md).

### Adding a screenshot

To get a hosted image URL for a new theme screenshot:

1. Capture it at `--size 2304x1360` so it matches the set.
2. Open any issue or pull request in this repo.
3. Drag the file into the comment box. GitHub uploads it and gives you a
   `https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/...` URL.
4. Use that URL in the `<img>` tag when adding the theme section above.
