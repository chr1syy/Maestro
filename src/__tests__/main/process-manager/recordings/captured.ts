/**
 * Captured turn recordings - real provider output, not hand-authored.
 *
 * Each JSON file in `captured/` is one real turn from a real binary: every
 * stdout chunk exactly as it arrived (same bytes, same boundaries), the stderr,
 * and the `close` event's code and signal. They sit beside the synthetic
 * recordings in fixtures.ts so the same two harnesses (desktop chat and the
 * CLI) replay both: the synthetic ones pin each edge case on purpose, these
 * prove the pipeline agrees with what providers actually write today.
 *
 * Three turns per provider, the three a user produces most: a normal turn, a
 * resumed turn (the second question in the same conversation), and a turn
 * stopped while a tool was running. Stopped turns are captured twice, once
 * per stop signal, because the two surfaces stop differently and the
 * providers answer each differently:
 *
 * - The desktop Stop button sends SIGINT (ProcessManager.interrupt). Claude
 *   Code answers it by writing an error result and exiting 0; OpenCode dies
 *   on the signal with no exit code.
 * - A CLI stop sends SIGTERM (linkAbortSignal in agent-spawner.ts). Claude
 *   Code exits 143 without a result; OpenCode again dies on the signal.
 *
 * Captured on macOS, 2026-09-28, Claude Code 2.1.282 and OpenCode 1.18.23,
 * with the args Maestro passes (see `command` in each file). New captures are
 * made with `scripts/record-provider-turn.mjs`, which does the trimming below
 * and refuses to write a file that still names the capturing machine. To keep the
 * capturing machine out of the repo, the Claude init event is trimmed: `cwd`
 * reads `/project`, MCP servers, skills and plugins are emptied, MCP tools and
 * plugin slash commands are dropped, and the local memory, scratchpad and
 * socket paths are removed. The parser reads none of those except
 * `slash_commands`, which keeps Claude Code's own commands. Em and en dashes
 * in provider text are replaced with hyphens (repo rule). Nothing else was
 * edited.
