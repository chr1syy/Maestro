/**
 * Turn recordings - maestro-lib Part Two.
 *
 * Synthetic (hand-authored, not captured) Claude Code stream-json JSONL
 * transcripts for the 9 turn-completion scenarios named in the maestro-lib
 * Part Two workplan: normal, resumed, interrupted, chunked, interleaved,
 * cut-stream, bad-exit-with-answer, silent-resume, and stop-vs-crash.
 *
 * There is no existing recorded-transcript fixture convention in this
 * codebase to build on (checked: no CLAUDE-SESSION.md wire-format reference,
 * no stdout-capture-to-disk tooling, StdoutHandler.test.ts and
 * ExitHandler.test.ts both hand-construct individual JSON events inline
 * rather than loading transcript files). Event shapes here are taken from
 * the real Claude Code output parser's own test fixtures
 * (src/__tests__/main/parsers/claude-output-parser.test.ts) as the plausible
 * source of truth, not fabricated from scratch.
 *
 * Each fixture is a sequence of raw `chunks` - strings fed to
 * `StdoutHandler.handleData()` one at a time, in order, exactly as they
 * would arrive from a child process's stdout. For most scenarios each chunk
 * is one complete JSON line; the `chunked`, `interleaved`, and `cut-stream`
 * fixtures deliberately split lines across chunk boundaries to exercise the
 * buffering behavior described in Plans/maestro-lib-turn-contract.md
 * section 4.
 *
 * Real captured turns (Claude Code and OpenCode: normal, resumed, stopped)
 * live in captured.ts and are merged into RECORDINGS below, so both replay
 * harnesses run them alongside these. So is one documented-format turn for
 * each provider that could not be captured (documented.ts).
