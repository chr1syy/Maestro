 * and `!errorText && (code === 0 || hasAnswer)`). Both now collect the same
 * `TurnFacts` the desktop chat collects and ask the shared
 * `resolveTurnOutcome` (src/shared/maestro-lib/streaming/turn-outcome.ts), so
 * the CLI, desktop chat and (later) Cue cannot disagree about it.
 *
 * This module is the only CLI-specific part: it translates the library's
 * four-valued outcome into the `AgentResult` shape every CLI caller already
 * consumes, and it keeps the two guarantees callers rely on that the library
 * deliberately leaves to its caller (see the notes on `strictEmptyAnswer` and
 * the non-zero-exit guard below).
