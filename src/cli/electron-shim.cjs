/**
 * What `require('electron')` resolves to inside the `maestro-cli` bundle
 * (aliased in `scripts/build-cli.mjs`).
 *
 * The CLI runs under plain Node, where there is no Electron API: on a headless
 * server the `electron` package is not installed at all, and where it is, it
 * exports a binary path string rather than `app`. Several main-process modules
 * the CLI reaches still import it - most importantly `electron-store`, which
 * reads `app` / `ipcMain` at construction and is pulled in by the standalone
 * Cue engine (cue-engine -> cue-executor -> cue-spawn-builder ->
 * resolveClaudeSpawnMode -> claudeUsageStore). Without this shim,
 * `maestro-cli cue engine start` dies on `Cannot find module 'electron'`.
 *
 * Only the surface those stores need is provided, and `app.getPath('userData')`
 * answers with the SAME directory the desktop app uses, so a store written here
 * is the file the desktop reads. Everything else stays `undefined`, so a module
 * that genuinely needs a window or a real IPC channel still fails loudly
 * instead of pretending to work. CommonJS on purpose: esbuild does not check
 * named imports against a CJS module, so `import { BrowserWindow } from
 * 'electron'` elsewhere keeps compiling and simply reads `undefined`.
