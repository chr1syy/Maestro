/**
 * useThoughtStreamCaptureListener - feeds the Thought Stream panel.
 *
 * Subscribes to the same raw `process:thinking-chunk` IPC stream as
 * `useAgentThinkingListener`, but routes chunks into `thoughtStreamStore`
 * INDEPENDENT of any tab's `showThinking` setting. This is what lets a user
 * introspect an Auto Run's reasoning even when thinking display is off.
 *
 * Capture is ambient: every owned session's chunks are buffered whether or not
 * the panel is open, so opening the stream on a run that has been hanging for
 * ten minutes shows those ten minutes rather than an empty log. The store
 * bounds the buffers (see MAX_THOUGHT_CHARS_PER_SESSION / MAX_CAPTURED_SESSIONS).
 *
 * Chunks are coalesced on a THOUGHT_FLUSH_MS timer, not requestAnimationFrame:
 * rAF is paused while the window is hidden or minimized, which is exactly when
 * a long unattended run is producing the reasoning the user later wants to read.
 * A timer keeps flushing (throttled, not stopped) in the background, and at one
 * store write every 250ms per session the always-on path stays cheap.

 * That single mint site is why this is a one-element set rather than a guess.
 *
 * Deliberately excluded:
 * - `ai-tab` / `legacy-ai`: ordinary conversation. This is the leak that made
 *   the panel show chat alongside a run.
 * - `synopsis`: background summarization of a finished turn. Not conversational,
 *   but not an Auto Run either, and attributing it to a run would misread it.
 * - `regular`: an unrecognized shape. Capturing the unknown is what produced the
