/**
 * The visible, clickable form of a `:codex-followup` directive.
 *
 * Codex ends a turn by offering its next moves as directives embedded in its
 * own markdown, so the transcript used to show the wire format verbatim -
 * `:codex-followup[Design the schema]{prompt="Design the canonical schema."}` -
 * which is both unreadable and unusable. This draws the offer as one chip the
 * reader can press.
 *
 * Two things about this chip are decided by the fact that BOTH halves of it are
 * agent-authored, and they are the whole design:
 *
 * 1. **The full prompt is always one hover away.** The label is the agent's
 *    summary of its own prompt, and nothing checks that the two agree. A chip
 *    reading "Tidy the imports" over a prompt that rewrites a config file must
 *    not be able to hide that, so the prompt is on the overlay and on the
 *    `aria-label` - the overlay for a reader with a mouse, the label for a
 *    screen reader and for anyone reaching the chip by keyboard, where
 *    `HoverTooltip` never fires.
 * 2. **Alt-click prefills instead of sending.** Editing an agent-authored
 *    prompt before it runs has to be one gesture away rather than a
 *    copy-paste out of a tooltip.
 *
 * A prompt-less chip renders as plain text. A button that sends nothing is
 * worse than no button: it reads as broken, and the label is still the only
 * content the directive carried.
 *
 * Both foreground and background derive from theme colors, so the text runs
 * through `readableTextOn` - a theme whose accent sits near its background
 * would otherwise paint near-invisible text on a tinted chip. Same reasoning as
 * `MarkerPill`, which this is modeled on.
