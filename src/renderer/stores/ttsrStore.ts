/**
 * Renderer-side TTSR display cache.
 *
 * Gate B of the TTSR plan: main owns every authoritative bit of TTSR state
 * (matching, repeat policy, injected-rule records). Nothing here is a source of
 * truth - it is a cache of the last push events so exit handling can tell a TTSR
 * abort apart from a failed turn.
 *
 * The {@link TtsrStore.matches} map is the display side of the same deal: it
 * counts `ttsr:matched` pushes so a non-interrupting rule is visible somewhere
 * instead of firing in total silence. Its consumer is the Right Bar Rules
 * panel, which renders one match line per rule. Those counts are per-renderer
 * and since
 * app start (in a browser client, since this browser session) - they are NOT
 * persisted and are NOT the injection counts main keeps in `ttsr-state.json`.
