/**
 * Helpers for handling files dragged into Maestro from the OS (Finder on macOS,

 * Electron removed the non-standard `File.path` property, so the absolute
 * filesystem path of a dropped file must be recovered via `webUtils`, which is
 * only reachable from the preload context. `window.maestro.fs.getPathForFile`
 * bridges to it. Folders dropped from the OS arrive as a single `File` entry
 * (the directory itself); the resolved path points at the folder and the main
 * process copies it recursively.
 *
 * In the web-desktop (browser) build there is no `webUtils` and no path to
 * recover, so `uploadPathlessFile` uploads the bytes to the machine running
 * Maestro instead.
