/**
 * Layout and navigation for the Git Log graph view.
 *
 * `GitGraphView` DRAWS the graph and `GitLogViewer` NAVIGATES it with the arrow
 * keys. Both go through this module, and both get their answer from the SAME
 * @gitgraph construction, because navigation here is VISUAL: an arrow key means
 * "the branch line drawn next to this one", not "the next entry in some list I
 * derived". Two derivations drift, and a horizontal jump that lands three
 * columns away loses the user's place on screen.
 *
 * The coordinate system is @gitgraph's own, read back from
 * `GitgraphCore.getRenderedData()`:
 * - `x` is the branch's COLUMN. Every branch gets a distinct x
 *   (`initCommitOffsetX + branch.spacing * order`), so a column IS a branch,
 *   and the columns sorted ascending read left to right on screen.
 * - `y` GROWS DOWNWARD and downward is older
 *   (`initCommitOffsetY + spacing * (maxRow - row)`), so the newest commit sits
 *   at the top of its column.
 *
 * Deriving the x order ourselves is exactly the bug this replaces: @gitgraph
 * orders its columns by when each branch first appears in ITS OWN commit
 * iteration, which is not the order a hand-written lane list produces, so
 * "one lane left" walked to a column somewhere else on screen.
