/**
 * Opening a `file://` link clicked in rendered markdown.
 *
 * These links are what the file-link plugins emit for a path OUTSIDE the
 * project root (`remarkFileLinks`, `markdownItAdapter`); a path inside it
 * becomes a `maestro-file://` link instead. The AI can also write a literal
 * `file://` link of its own, so this is not only a generated shape.
 *
 * Historically every one of them went straight to `shell.openPath`, which is
 * right for a PDF and wrong for everything Maestro renders better itself: a
 * JSON, a log, a config, a source file, or an MP3 handed to the OS pops a
 * second application over the top of the workspace to do something the file
 * preview (or the floating player) already does. Being outside the project
 * root is not a reason to eject the user from the app.
 *
 * The routing question is the same one the file tree already answers, so this
 * asks `shouldOpenExternally()` - the single policy for "the OS owns this file
 * type" (PDFs, Office docs, archives, binaries, formats Chromium cannot
 * decode). Anything else goes back through the caller's file-click handler,
 * which funnels into `handleOpenFileTab` - the choke point that opens a
 * preview tab and diverts playable media to the floating player.

 * The filesystem path behind a `file://` href, or null when the href is not

 *
 * Percent-decoding is NOT optional. A `file://` href is a URL, so every
 * producer reaching this point has already encoded it: an agent writes
 * `file:///a/Voice%20Cloning/x.wav` by hand, and mdast-util-to-hast runs
 * every link destination through `normalizeUri` besides. Handing that
 * literal string to `fs.readFile` is an ENOENT, which the file-click handler
 * reports by returning - so the click silently does nothing for any path
 * containing a space, a `#`, or a non-ASCII character. Same rule, same
