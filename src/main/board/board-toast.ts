/**
 * User-facing toast payload for a terminal Board card transition (Board I1).
 *
 * A finished (or blocked) card surfaces to the user as a toast over the SAME
 * `remote:notifyToast` relay Cue's notify action uses. The only durable trace of
 * a pooled run is its `workerAgentId`, so - mirroring the Cue precedent in
 * `src/main/cue/cue-notify-bridge.ts` - the toast body is made a click-to-jump
 * affordance onto that worker agent whenever the run recorded one. Legacy
 * profile-based runs have no `workerAgentId` and keep the non-clickable toast.
 *
 * Pure and Electron-free so it can be unit-tested directly; `notifyCard` in
 * `src/main/index.ts` hands the result straight to `safeSend`.
