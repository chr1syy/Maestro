/**
 * Board auto-decompose (Board Phase 5) - OPTIONAL, OFF by default.
 *
 * When a board has `autoDecompose: true`, the dispatcher may take a `triage`
 * card, run ONE LLM pass over it, and fan it into a small graph of child cards
 * with their parent dependencies wired. This is a strictly additive layer: with
 * the flag off (the default), triage cards are never auto-expanded and simply
 * wait for manual promotion, so the manual Board (Phases 1-4) stays fully
 * useful on its own.
 *
 * This module is framework-free (no Electron, no filesystem, no prompt-registry
 * import) so it runs in the CLI `board tick` and the desktop dispatcher alike.
 * The prompt template and the spawn are injected; the caller loads the editable
 * `board-decompose` prompt (`getPrompt` in main, `getCliPrompt` in the CLI) and
 * supplies the agent-spawn callback.
 *
 * Runaway guard: at most `maxPerTick` triage cards are decomposed per pass
 * (default 3, mirroring Hermes' `auto_decompose_per_tick`). A decomposed triage
 * card is moved OUT of `triage` (to `done`) so it is never re-expanded on the
 * next tick.
