/**
 * Board dispatcher - the orchestration that makes a Board actually run.
 *
 * This is the Phase 3 core. It is deliberately "pure-ish": all side effects
 * (loading/saving the board, resolving a profile, spawning an agent) are
 * injected as callbacks, so the promotion / WIP-cap / completion logic can be
 * unit-tested with a fake board and a fake spawner - no Electron, no
 * filesystem, no real process.
 *
 * One {@link BoardDispatcher} instance owns exactly one board (identified by the
 * `loadBoard`/`saveBoard` closures it is handed). The Cue engine constructs one
 * per board and calls {@link BoardDispatcher.tick} on each engine tick.
 *
 * Per tick the dispatcher:
 *   1. Reclaims stale `running` cards (a run that outlived its process because
 *      the engine restarted mid-flight) back to `ready`.
 *   2. Promotes `todo` cards whose parents are all `done` to `ready`
 *      (via the Phase 2 {@link getEligibleCards}).
 *   3. While running-count < `maxInProgress`, claims the oldest `ready` card,
 *      marks it `running`, opens a {@link CardRun}, and spawns its assignee.
 *   4. On spawn completion, parses the output for card markers and moves the
 *      card to `done` or `blocked` (marker wins; else the process exit status
 *      decides), recording the outcome on the open run. A card that fails
 *      `maxFailures` times in a row is force-blocked (the circuit breaker).
 *
 * The board is persisted synchronously after step 3, BEFORE any spawn resolves,
 * so a crash or the next tick sees the claimed cards as `running` and never
 * double-dispatches them.
