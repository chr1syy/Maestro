/**
 * Board storage - single owner of `.maestro/board.yaml`.
 *
 * Mirrors the Cue config (`.maestro/cue.yaml`) and Phase 1 profiles
 * (`.maestro/profiles.yaml`) conventions: all filesystem reads/writes for the
 * board file flow through this module so path resolution and directory creation
 * live in exactly one place. Uses the shared `js-yaml` helper - no new
 * dependency.
 *
 * The file format is a single top-level `boards:` list, each board holding its
 * own `cards:`:
 *
 *   boards:
 *     - id: 8f3c…
 *       name: Backend rework
 *       maxInProgress: 2
 *       cards:
 *         - id: a
 *           title: Design schema
 *           body: …
 *           assigneeProfileId: reviewer
 *           parents: []
 *           status: todo
 *           createdAt: 2026-07-10T00:00:00.000Z
 *           updatedAt: 2026-07-10T00:00:00.000Z
 *
 * Load validates each board/card via the shared validators and skips malformed
 * cards with a logged warning, so one bad entry never blocks the rest. Save
 * refuses to persist a board whose parent graph contains a cycle (Phase 3
 * relies on the DAG being acyclic).
 *
 * Writes are atomic (temp file + rename via `atomicWriteFileSync`) so a crash
 * or a concurrent reader never observes a truncated board.yaml, and async
 * read-modify-write callers serialize per file through
 * {@link enqueueBoardWrite}.
