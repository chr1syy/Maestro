/**
 * Board per-card "open PR when done" (Board F3).
 *
 * A card that opted into worktree isolation ({@link BoardCard.worktree}) runs on
 * its own branch, and nothing merges that branch automatically. `prOnDone` turns
 * the last step into a pull request: when the card lands in `done` with a branch
 * recorded on its latest run, this module pushes the branch and opens the PR
 * through the shared {@link createPullRequest} helper - the same gh-CLI plumbing
 * the `git:createPR` IPC handler uses.
 *
 * There are exactly TWO transitions into `done` and both route through
 * {@link maybeCreateCardPr}: the dispatcher's `finalize` (the run completed on
 * its own) and the manual `board:setCardStatus` approval move (a human moved a
 * `review` card to Done). The gate is re-evaluated here against a freshly loaded
 * board, so a caller that fires it speculatively costs nothing.
 *
 * A PR failure NEVER changes the card's status - the work is done either way,
 * only the pull request is missing. The failure is warn-logged, red-toasted and
 * persisted as `run.prError` so the user can open the PR by hand.
