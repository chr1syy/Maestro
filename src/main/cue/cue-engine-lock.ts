/**
 * Cross-process lock preventing two Cue engine loops (the desktop app and a
 * standalone `maestro-cli cue engine` runner, or two standalone runners) from
 * dispatching the SAME subscriptions at once.
 *
 * Both runners read the SAME on-disk state for a given data directory -
 * `.maestro/cue.yaml` per project, and one shared `cue.db` (see
 * `resolveUserDataDir()` in `src/shared/userDataDir.ts`). Without coordination, a
 * user who leaves the desktop app open AND starts the standalone engine (for
 * unattended operation when the desktop app is closed) would get every
 * trigger firing TWICE - two agent processes spawned per `time.heartbeat`
 * tick, a GitHub PR poller finding and dispatching the same PR from two
 * independent poll loops, etc. `CueRunManager`'s `max_concurrent` guard and
 * `activeRootKeys` self-overlap check (see CLAUDE-CUE.md) only serialize runs
 * WITHIN one engine instance; they have no visibility into a second process.
 *
 * This is deliberately a SINGLE global lock per data directory, not a
 * per-project one: `cue.db` is one shared database (see `initCueDb()`),
 * and the event queue / history / telemetry outbox tables it holds have no
 * per-project isolation either, so two engines writing to it concurrently
 * would race on it independently of which projects each happens to own.
 *
 * The lock is advisory (a JSON file), not an OS-level file lock - `fs.flock`
 * has no cross-platform equivalent in plain Node, and an advisory lock is
 * sufficient here because both callers (the desktop main process and the
 * standalone CLI command) are Maestro's own code and check it cooperatively
 * before starting the engine. It is NOT a substitute for a real mutex against
 * an adversarial writer.
 *
 * A live PID alone is not proof of ownership. PIDs are reused - after a
 * reboot, and routinely inside a container, where every restart hands out the
 * same small numbers again - so a lock left by a SIGKILLed engine can name an
 * unrelated process that happens to be alive. Trusting that would block every
 * restart and, worse, let `cue engine stop` SIGTERM a stranger. A lock
 * therefore also records the system boot time and a heartbeat the owner
 * refreshes (`touchCueEngineLock`, every {@link CUE_ENGINE_LOCK_HEARTBEAT_MS}):
 * a lock from an earlier boot, or one whose heartbeat has been quiet for
 * {@link CUE_ENGINE_LOCK_STALE_MS}, is stale whatever its PID says.
