 * provider session id (to `--resume`) and the original goal (to restate on the
 * degraded `fresh` path for agents that never emit an id mid-turn).
 *
 * The registry is fed from the public `spawn` / `session-id` / `exit`
 * ProcessManager events, so the process manager keeps no TTSR dependency
 * (Gate B: this state is main-authoritative and lives here, not on the
