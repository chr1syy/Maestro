/**
 * Board - shared contracts.
 *
 * A Board is a persistent task DAG stored per-project in `.maestro/board.yaml`
 * (human-diffable, git-trackable, mirroring the Cue `.maestro/cue.yaml`
 * convention). Each **card** is a unit of work assigned to an Agent Profile
 * (Phase 1) and gated on its parent cards: a card becomes eligible to run only
 * once every parent it lists is `done`. Phase 2 (this module) is the data
 * foundation only - no dispatcher (Phase 3) and no rich UI (Phase 4).
 *
 * This module is pure and framework-free (no Electron/React imports) so it can
 * run in main, renderer, and CLI alike.

/**
 * Lifecycle status of a card.
 *
 * - `triage`  - captured but not yet groomed; needs a human decision before it
 *               can move to `todo`. Never auto-run.
 * - `todo`    - accepted work, waiting on its parents. The author's default
 *               resting state for a real task. Two populations live here: cards
 *               that have never run, and cards a user stopped mid-run, which
 *               stay `todo` but carry {@link BoardCard.heldByUser} and are never
 *               auto-promoted until a person resumes them.
 * - `ready`   - derived/promoted: a `todo` card whose parents are all `done`,
 *               eligible for dispatch. Phase 3 computes this; authors do NOT
 *               hand-write it (see {@link getEligibleCards}).
 * - `running` - a dispatcher has spawned an agent for this card and it is in
 *               flight.
 * - `review`  - the run reached a deliberate conclusion but needs a HUMAN to
 *               approve or verify it before it counts. Not a failure: nothing
 *               went wrong, the work simply requires human judgment. Like
 *               `blocked` it does NOT unblock children (only `done` does), and
 *               it is never auto-retried. A person approves by moving the card
 *               `review` -> `done`, which is the only approval path.
 * - `blocked` - a run finished without completing (agent reported a blocker) or
 *               a parent regressed; needs attention before it can retry.
 * - `done`    - completed successfully; unblocks children that depend on it.
