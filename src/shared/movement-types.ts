 * (see components/BlockView). Shared across the CLI command, the main-process
 * bridge, the preload bridge, and the renderer store so every layer agrees on
 * one payload shape.
 *
 * The agent composes with awareness of the current layout via a `state` read
 * (MovementStateSnapshot), so it can place new items without overlapping.
