/**
 * Build environment for child process (non-PTY) spawning - typically for AI agents.
 *
 * This is the core function for setting up environments for spawned AI agents (Claude Code,
 * Codex, Factory Droid, etc.) and other child processes. It implements a strict precedence
 * order and safety measures to prevent agent authentication failures.
 *
 * **Environment Precedence (highest to lowest)**:
 * 1. **Session-level custom env vars** (from spawn request, highest priority)
 *    - Set per-session in the spawn config
 *    - Intended for temporary overrides
 *    - Example: Override API_KEY for a specific test session
 *
 * 2. **Global shell env vars** (from Settings → General → Shell Configuration)
 *    - Set once by user, applies to all agents and terminals
 *    - Persisted in electron-store
 *    - Example: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, PROXY_URL
 *
 * 3. **Process environment** (with Electron/IDE vars stripped, lowest priority)
 *    - Parent process environment as baseline
 *    - Problematic vars removed to prevent auth failures
 *
 * **Safety Features**:
 * - Strips Electron internals (ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE, etc.)
 * - Strips IDE markers (CLAUDECODE, etc.)
 * - Strips Maestro's NODE_ENV to avoid conflicts
 * - Applies path expansion for `~/` syntax
 * - Sets MAESTRO_SESSION_RESUMED flag when resuming sessions
 *
 * @param {Record<string, string>} [customEnvVars] - Session-level environment variables that
 *        override global and defaults. These are typically set per-spawn for session-specific
 *        needs. Supports `~/` path expansion. Optional - if not provided, only global vars are used.
 *
 * @param {boolean} [isResuming] - Whether this process is being resumed (vs. fresh spawn).
 *        When true, sets MAESTRO_SESSION_RESUMED=1 in environment so agents can detect resumption.
 *        Optional, defaults to false.
 *
 * @param {Record<string, string>} [globalShellEnvVars] - Global environment variables from
 *        Settings that should apply to all agents. These come from Settings → General → Shell
 *        Configuration. Supports `~/` path expansion. Optional - if not provided, no global
 *        vars are applied.
 *
 * @returns {NodeJS.ProcessEnv} The complete environment object ready to pass to spawn/exec.
 *          Includes all three levels of vars merged with correct precedence.
 *
 * @example
 * // Spawn agent with only global vars (typical use)
 * const globalVars = {
 *   'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY': 'sk-proj-xxxxx',
 *   'DEBUG': 'maestro:*'
 * };
 * const env = buildChildProcessEnv(undefined, false, globalVars);
 * spawn('claude-code', [], { env });
 *
 * @example
 * // Spawn agent with session override of global var
 * const sessionVars = { 'DEBUG': 'off' };  // Override global DEBUG setting
 * const env = buildChildProcessEnv(sessionVars, false, globalVars);
 * // Result: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from global, DEBUG='off' from session (session wins)
 *
 * @example
 * // Spawn agent on resume with session-specific tracking
 * const env = buildChildProcessEnv(undefined, true, globalVars);
 * // Sets MAESTRO_SESSION_RESUMED=1 so agent knows session was resumed
 *
 * @note Path expansion is applied to all values at all levels (e.g., ~/workspace → /home/user/workspace)
 * @note Variables at higher precedence levels completely replace lower levels (no merging for same key)
 * @note Electron/IDE variables are stripped FIRST before any merging, ensuring they never appear
 *
 * @see STRIPPED_ENV_VARS - List of variables that are always removed
 * @see buildPtyTerminalEnv() - Similar function for PTY terminal environments
