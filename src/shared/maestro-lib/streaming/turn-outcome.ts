/**
 * Turn outcome resolution - maestro-lib Part Two.
 *
 * Implements the "1. Turn termination" section of
 * `Plans/maestro-lib-turn-contract.md`: a single, pure, provider-agnostic
 * function that maps the facts a running turn produced onto one of four
 * outcomes. Desktop chat, the CLI, and Cue currently reimplement this
 * independently and disagree (see the contract doc's "Why this exists"
 * section); this module is the one place the logic lives once migration
 * lands.
 *
 * `resolveTurnOutcome` does not decide whether the exit should be processed
 * at all - the caller must apply the spawn-generation/supersession check
 * (`ExitHandler.ts:114-121`) before calling this, since a superseded exit
 * produces no outcome, not `crashed`. It also does not perform provisional-
 * error resolution, SSH transport-error matching, or Copilot's async
 * post-exit reconciliation - those all feed into `TurnFacts.explicitError`
 * and `TurnFacts.capturedAnswerText` before this function runs; by the time
 * `TurnFacts` exists, those are already resolved.

/**
 * Resolve a turn's outcome from its facts. Pure - no I/O, no emission, no
 * mutation of its arguments.
 *
 * Precedence (see `Plans/maestro-lib-turn-contract.md`, section 1):
 *  1. `interrupted` wins outright, before any error is considered.
 *  2. An already-resolved `explicitError` -> crashed.
 *  3. The provider's own `detectErrorFromExit` -> crashed. `facts.exitCode`
 *     is coerced to `0` here when `null` (a signal-terminated process) purely
 *     because the provider callback's signature requires a `number` - this
 *     does NOT mean a signal-killed exit is treated as clean; rule 3a below
 *     independently catches the case where that coercion would otherwise let
 *     a signal kill masquerade as success.
 * 3a. An unrequested signal kill -> crashed, whatever was captured. Rule 1
 *     already took every stop the caller asked for, so a signal here came
 *     from outside the turn (a shutdown, an OOM kill, a container stop) and
 *     cut it short: streamed text is a truncated answer, and even a result
 *     event does not make the kill a success. The CLI and Cue enforced this
 *     at their own call sites; desktop, which never saw the signal, reported
 *     a clean finish. It lives here now so no caller can drop it again.
 * 3b. The prompt could not be written to stdin -> crashed, whatever the exit
 *     code and whatever was captured: the agent answered, if at all, something
 *     other than what it was asked. It comes after the provider's own
 *     classification and an outside kill, either of which says better why
 *     the process went away.
 *  4. No captured answer AND no explicit done signal (`resultMessageSeen`)
 *     -> crashed, when the empty-answer-on-clean-exit rule applies (omp
 *     today; see `generalizeEmptyAnswerRule`), except for the known excluded
 *     session shapes (terminal / synopsis / tab-naming runs). Requiring
 *     `!resultMessageSeen` here (not just `!hasAnswer`) matters: a provider
 *     that already sent an explicit result event before exiting empty-handed
 *     already completed its turn, and must not be reclassified as a crash
 *     just because `capturedAnswerText` happens to be empty at this call site.
 *  5. Clean exit with an explicit done signal -> completed.
 *  6. A captured answer despite a non-zero exit or a missing done signal ->
 *     completed-with-warning.
 *  7. Otherwise (no answer, not subject to rule 4, no other signal) ->
 *     completed. This is deliberately NOT `crashed`: it is the literal
 *     "indistinguishable from success" state every non-omp provider is left
 *     in today when nothing else fired, and changing that silently would be
 *     the same unreviewed behavior change rule 4 already flags.
