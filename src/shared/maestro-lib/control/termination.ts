 * Stop a process: interrupt, then terminate, then kill its tree.

 * Desktop's interrupt checked `child.killed` to decide whether to escalate,
 * which Node sets as soon as a signal is SENT, so on POSIX an agent that
 * ignored SIGINT was never escalated at all. Desktop's kill never followed
 * SIGTERM with SIGKILL for a pipe child. The CLI had no Windows tree kill.
 * None of them stopped what the agent had started.
 *
 * The rules, in one place:
 * - "Stop requested" is recorded before the first signal.
 * - A process is running while `exitCode` and `signalCode` are both null.
 *   `child.killed` says a signal was sent, not that anything died.
 * - Every stage schedules the next, for pipes and PTYs alike.
 * - Descendants are recorded before the first signal, re-read while the stop
 *   is pending, and swept once the process exits, because an agent that exits
 *   on a signal leaves its tools running.
 * - A tree is only killed when the pid is provably a running child of this
 *   process. Anything else gets the signal through its own handle and no more.
