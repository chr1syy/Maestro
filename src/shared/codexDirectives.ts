/**
 * The Codex assistant-directive grammar, ported from OpenAI's
 * `codex-rs/tui/src/assistant_directives.rs`.
 *
 * Codex writes structured annotations straight into its assistant markdown, so
 * what arrives in a transcript is prose with machine-readable spans embedded in
 * it. A suggested next action looks like this on the wire:
 *
 *     - :codex-followup[Design the schema]{prompt="Design the canonical schema."}
 *
 * Maestro renders that verbatim today, which is the bug this module starts to
 * close. The emitting convention is fixed by the first-party Codex plugin
 * skills bundled on disk (`skills/documents/SKILL.md`), so the grammar is a
 * wire format: it is decided by the producer and Maestro only gets to read it.
 *
 * Nothing here renders. This is the parser alone - one directive at the head of
 * a string (`parseCodexDirective`) and every KNOWN directive in a whole string
 * with its offsets (`findCodexDirectives`).
 *
 * Two rules run through the whole file, and both exist to stop the parser from
 * eating text that was never a directive:
 *
 * 1. **A failed parse returns `null`, never a partial directive.** A caller
 *    replaces exactly `raw` and leaves the rest of the line alone, so a parser
 *    that guessed at a boundary would silently delete the user's prose.
 * 2. **A directive is single-line.** A newline inside a label, inside a quoted
 *    value, or where a separator is expected fails the parse. Without that, an
 *    unterminated quote in one message swallows every line after it.
 */

/**
 * How far the scanner may read before giving up on a candidate.
 *
 * The budget bounds a pathological input: `::a{k="` followed by a megabyte of
 * text is an unterminated quote, and without a cap the scanner reads the whole
 * megabyte to discover that. No real directive comes close to 8 KiB, so a
