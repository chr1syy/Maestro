/**
 * Maestro Plugin Host API contract version.
 *
 * This is the SINGLE source of truth for the version of the host surface that
 * plugins are written against. It becomes a permanent, semver-managed public
 * contract the moment the first plugin ships (Track B Phase 1), so treat any
 * change here with the same care as a breaking API change:
 *
 * - Bump the PATCH when fixing a bug in host behavior that does not change the
 *   shape of what plugins can rely on.
 * - Bump the MINOR when ADDING a contribution point, manifest field, or host
 *   capability in a backward-compatible way (older plugins keep working).
 * - Bump the MAJOR when REMOVING or changing the meaning of any existing
 *   contribution point, manifest field, or host capability.
 *
 * A plugin declares the minimum host API it needs via `maestro.minHostApi` in
 * its plugin.json. The host loads the plugin only when its own version
 * satisfies that minimum (same-major, host >= min). See isHostApiCompatible.

/**
 * The host API version this Maestro build implements. Bumped to 1.16.0 for three
 * backward-compatible additions: the metadata-only `session.activated` event
 * topic (`{ sessionId, tabId? }`, opaque ids only, fired when the focused agent
 * changes), the `sessions.focus` method plus its narrow `sessions:focus`
 * capability (navigate to an existing session's AI tab; no tab create/close
 * power), and the summonable-panel trio `ui.openPanel` / `ui.closePanel` /
 * `ui.togglePanel` under the existing `ui:panel` capability alongside the
 * optional panel manifest field `size?: 'default' | 'full'` (absent or invalid
 * => `default`, so older manifests are untouched). 1.15.0 is taken by the Board
 * + Profiles work, so this fork skips it. 1.14.0 added the
 * backward-compatible additive `tool.executed` event topic (metadata-only tool
 * lifecycle: name + timing, never arguments or results) plus the `ui.panelPost`
 * host-to-panel push method (own-panels-only, JSON-only, MAX_PANEL_POST_BYTES
 * cap). 1.13.0 added the additive host-mediated `PluginUiSurface` registry and
 * trusted-chrome guard. 1.12.0 added the backward-compatible additive
 * `net:connect` capability plus its `net.connect` / `net.send` / `net.close`
 * host methods (hold an outbound persistent websocket to a host scope, e.g. a
 * Discord/Slack gateway; egress-classified). 1.11.0 added virtual `groupings`
 * contributions and the presentation-only `ui:grouping` publish/clear methods;
 * 1.10.0 added the backward-compatible, data-only `iconPacks` contribution;
 * 1.9.0 added host-rendered `hostViews`, their `ui:hostView` capability, and the
 * `ui.hostViewUpdate` / `ui.hostViewRemove` RPC methods; 1.8.0 added
 * `background.list`; 1.7.0 added history/session/tab/transcript
 * write/decision/shell/storage SQL/fs watch/power/background capabilities plus
 * `history.entryAdded` and metadata-only `agent.completed` events; 1.6.0 added
 * `cue.runStarted` / `cue.runFinished`; 1.5.0 added `agent.exited` /
 * `agent.error` / `usage.updated` / `run.completed` + functional
 * `sidebar`/`activity-bar`/`toolbar` uiItem surfaces; 1.4.0 added the
 * `ui:contribute` / `ui:panel` / `ui:render-unsafe` UI capabilities; 1.3.0
 * added `tools` + `keybindings`; 1.2.0 added `transcripts:read`.
