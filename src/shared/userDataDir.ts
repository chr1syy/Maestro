/**
 * Maestro's data directory, resolved without Electron.
 *
 * The desktop app gets this from `app.getPath('userData')`. A process that has
 * no Electron - the CLI, and the standalone Cue runner this exists for - has to
 * arrive at the SAME directory, or the two disagree about what state exists.
 *
 * The app's own rule, mirrored here:
 *   1. `MAESTRO_USER_DATA` wins. The app sets it on its OWN process env at
 *      startup (`src/main/index.ts`), so anything the app spawns inherits it and
 *      lands in the right place by construction. A CLI the user starts from
 *      their own terminal does NOT inherit it and falls through to step 2.
 *   2. Otherwise the platform default plus the app name, and the app name is
 *      NOT constant: Electron uses `package.json` `name` ("maestro") when
 *      running unpackaged and the bundle's `productName` ("Maestro") once
 *      packaged. Both spellings exist in the wild, which is why the fallbacks
 *      scattered around this repo disagree with each other.
 *   3. Development adds one more hop: the app redirects to a sibling
 *      `maestro-dev` directory unless `USE_PROD_DATA` is set.
 *
 * Everything is injectable so the branches can be tested without pretending to
 * be another OS.
