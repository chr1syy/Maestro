 * For claude-code, `liveProse: true` is honest at token granularity: the CLI is
 * spawned with `--include-partial-messages` (see `src/main/agents/definitions.ts`)
 * and the parser emits per-token `text` deltas from `stream_event`
 * content_block_delta objects, so prose partials reach `handleParsedEvent`
 * mid-turn instead of only as one complete assistant message at end of turn.
 * That makes prose-only turns preventable (real mid-turn abort), not just
 * corrective. The closing complete assistant event is stamped
 * `textAlreadyStreamed` so downstream consumers do not double-count the prose.
 *
 * claude-code `toolEvents: true` and `ast: 'full'` are honest but coarser than
 * `liveProse`: they are assistant-message-boundary grained, not token grained.
 * Tool inputs never stream token-by-token because the parser intentionally
 * drops `input_json_delta` stream events (see `transformStreamEvent` in
 * `src/main/parsers/claude-output-parser.ts`); the full `{ file_path, content }`
 * payload only reaches TTSR on the complete assistant message that closes the
 * block. That is still PRE-execution - the matching `tool_result` arrives later
 * on a separate user message - so mid-turn `tool:write` / `tool:edit`
 * interrupts and full ast-grep matching over the written content are real, they
 * just fire once per tool call rather than as the arguments are typed.
 *
 * Agents absent from the plan's scope table (gemini-cli, qwen3-coder, hermes,
 * pi, omp, antigravity) are marked unsupported rather than guessed at; they gain support
